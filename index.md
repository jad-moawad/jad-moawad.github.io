I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of New Economic Thinking, University of Oxford. My main research interests lie at the intersection of economic sociology and quantitative political economy.

I am the Principle Investigator for the SNSF grant, where I plan to explore the intricacies of the determinants of wealth among different subgroups. In addition, I will analyze consumption and saving patterns across the United States and Europe.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Social Sciences from the University of Lausanne, where I studied the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. My research shed light on its far-reaching impact on various societal dimensions, in particular on income and health inequalities.

I worked with several large-scale surveys such as the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Social Survey (ESS), and the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). In addition, I've recently started designing experiments that explore societal attitudes towards wealth redistribution.

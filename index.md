  <h1>Jad Moawad</h1>
  <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>, the <a href="https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Social Policy and Intervention</a>, and associate member at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a>, University of Oxford.</p>

  <p>My main research interests lie at the intersection of economic sociology and quantitative political economy.</p>
  
  <p>I am the principal investigator for the SNSF grant, where I plan to explore the intricacies of the determinants of wealth among different subgroups. In addition, I will analyze consumption and saving patterns across the United States and Europe.<p>

  <p>Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Social Sciences from the University of Lausanne, where I studied the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. My research shed light on its far-reaching impact on various societal dimensions, in particular on income and health inequalities.<p>

  <p>I worked with several large-scale surveys such as the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Social Survey (ESS), and the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). In addition, I've recently started designing experiments that explore societal attitudes towards wealth redistribution.<p>

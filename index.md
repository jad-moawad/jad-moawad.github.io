  <h1>Jad Moawad</h1>

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>, the <a href="https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Social Policy and Intervention</a>, and associate member at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a>, University of Oxford.
  My main research interests lie at the intersection of economic sociology and quantitative political economy.

I am the principal investigator for the SNSF grant on the determinants of wealth, saving and consumption behavior. I analyze these outcomes in Europe and the United States.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Social Sciences from the University of Lausanne, where I studied the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. My research shed light on its far-reaching effects on various social dimensions, in particular on income and health inequalities.

I have worked with several large-scale surveys such as the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Social Survey (ESS), and the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). In addition, I've recently started designing experiments that explore societal attitudes towards wealth redistribution.
